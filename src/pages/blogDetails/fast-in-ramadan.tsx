          How Muslims Keep Fast in Ramadan
        </Text>

        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          Fasting during Ramadan is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and the most blessed month of the year, related to
          prayers and zeal within the clear Form of Religion. For millions of Muslims around the world, fasting is such
          a valued religious practice because it gives rise to the feelings of community, thankfulness, and restraint.

          Ramadan fasting is a command of God, as it is said in the Quran.

          <blockquote className="italic text-[#78827F] mt-2">
            "You who have believed. Worship is ordained on you in the way that it was ordained on those before you so

          The main goals of fasting are:

            <li>Building self-control and willpower.</li>
            <li>Building a stronger relationship with Allah.</li>

        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          Ramadan fasting means staying away from food and drink, cigarettes, and sex from dawn (Fajr) to dusk (Maghrib)
          â€” not just physical renunciation but also renouncing misdeeds such as lying, backbiting, anger, and gossip.

        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) related:
          <br />
          <blockquote className="italic text-[#78827F] mt-2">
            "Whosoever does not leave off false speech (i.e., lying), and evil deeds, and cursing individuals, Allah
            does not need him to leave off his food and drink." (Bukhari)

        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] mt-2 text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          There are two major phases of fasting in Islam:
          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mt-4">
            <li>Suhoor (Pre-Dawn Meal): A light nutritious meal consumed before the morning prayer.</li>
            <li>
              Iftar (Breaking of the Fast): An evening meal traditionally opened with dates and water, followed by a
              wholesome meal.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <Text className="font-Raleway mt-2 font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          With My Mufti App, users come to know precise suhoor and iftar time based on where they are in order to take
          the right fasting schedule.

          3. Who Should Fast?
        </Text>
        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          It is obligatory upon all adult Muslim men and women who have normal physical and mental health to observe
          fasting. It is, however, exempt for those experiencing sincere hardships, namely:
          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mt-4">
            <li>Children (under puberty)</li>
            <li>The elderly (who are weak and may not be able to bear the fast)</li>
            <li>Nursing women and pregnant females (if fasting may adversely affect their health or the fetus)</li>
            <li>Sick people (with medical issues that make fasting difficult)</li>
            <li>Travelers (embarking on long journeys)</li>
            <li>Women on menstruation or Nifas (they will have to catch up on missed fasts later)</li>
          </ul>
        </Text>
        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          Those unable to fast due to continuous illness or extreme old age can compensate by giving food to a poor
          person for every missed fast (Fidya). My Mufti App provides Fidya calculation advice and instructions on how
          to fulfill this responsibility.

          4. Suhoor for Fasting: Importance of Pre-Fasting Breakfast
        </Text>
        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          Suhoor is of prime importance since it keeps one going throughout the day. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)
          explained:
          <br />
          <blockquote className="italic text-[#78827F] mt-2">
            "Eat Suhoor, as it definitely holds a blessing." (Sahih Bukhari & Muslim)

        </Text>
        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          A healthy Suhoor consists of:
          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mt-4">
            <li>Complex carbohydrates (e.g., oats, whole-grain bread, brown rice)</li>
            <li>Proteins (e.g., eggs, yogurt, cheese, nuts)</li>
            <li>Fresh fruits and vegetables loaded with vitamins and water</li>
            <li> Regardless, one must have enough water intake to avoid dehydration during the day.</li>

        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          At sunset, Muslims break their fasting according to the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH):
          <br />
          <blockquote className="italic text-[#78827F] mt-2">
            "When one of you breaks his fast, let him break it with dates, for they are blessed. If he does not have
            dates, then with water, for it is pure." (Abu Dawood)
          </blockquote>
        </Text>
        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          A healthy Iftar should consist of:
          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mt-4">
            <li>Dates and water to replenish energy and hydration.</li>
            <li>Lean protein and vegetables for a balanced diet.</li>
            <li>Avoiding fried and highly processed foods to avoid sluggishness.</li>
          </ul>

        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          Numerous families and communities gather together for Iftar, creating a feeling of togetherness and

          for a healthy Ramadan.

            <li>Extra Salah: Taraweeh prayers attract very big spiritual prizes and are offered at night.</li>

            <li>
              Asking for forgiveness and making du'a: Muslims seek Allah's mercy through very heart-touching

          The last ten nights of Ramadan are those that have the most spiritual significance, as they harbor within them
          Laylatul Qadr, a night better than a thousand months (Quran 97:3). These are the nights during which Muslims
          engage themselves the most in prayers, recitation of the Quran, and requests for forgiveness.
          <br />
          The Prophet (PBUH) made me confident in locating Laylatul Qadr on odd nights of the remaining ten days. My

          Eid al-Fitr is celebrated at the end of Ramadan with a special prayer. Collective charity referred to as Zakat
          al-fitr is where people participate. It also serves as a reason for the family reunion. It expresses a point
          of thanks for the weaknesses involved in upholding the fast and a celebration of the blessings of Ramadan.
        </Text>
        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          It is necessary for Zakat al-Fitr to be extended on account of the fact that the needy people should have the
          opportunity to partake in the Eid festivities before the Eid prayers are conducted.
          <br />
          My Mufti App is just a means of doing right for Fitr Zakat and celebration preparation as per the teachings of
