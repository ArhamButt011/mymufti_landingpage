          What is Halal Food?
        </Text>

        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          Food is one of the fundamental aspects of life, and for Muslims, it is essential that the food they consume aligns with Islamic principles. Halal food refers to food that is permissible for Muslims to eat under Islamic law, as outlined in the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). It is not limited to just meat; halal encompasses all food and drinks that are in accordance with Islamic guidelines, including purity, hygiene, and ethical sourcing.

          1. Understanding the Idea of Halal
        </Text>
        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          The term "Halal" is an Arabic word meaning "permitted" or "lawful." It applies to every aspect of a Muslim’s life, including food, finances, clothing, and behavior. In contrast, "Haram" refers to things that are forbidden. When discussing food, Halal refers to anything that complies with Islamic teachings, while Haram refers to anything clearly forbidden.

        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          The Quran states:
          <blockquote className="italic text-[#78827F] mt-2">
            "O you who have believed, eat from the good things which We have provided for you and be grateful to Allah if it is [indeed] Him that you worship." (Quran 2:172)
          </blockquote>
          This verse stresses the consumption of wholesome and legal food and emphasizes the significance of Halal dietary practices.

          2. Halal Meat and Slaughtering Process (Zabiha)
        </Text>
        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          In order for the meat to be Halal, it should originate from an allowed animal and be slaughtered according to Islamic law. The method, referred to as Zabiha, needs certain conditions to be fulfilled:
        </Text>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mt-4 text-[#78827F]">
          <li>  The Animal Has to Be Halal:   Islam allows the intake of animals like cows, sheep, goats, chickens, and camels. Animals like pigs and carnivorous hunters are forbidden.</li>
          <li>  The Slaughtering Must Be Done by a Sane, Adult Muslim:   The animal being slaughtered should be slaughtered by a sane person who is an adult and recites Bismillah (In the name of Allah) and Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Greatest) before cutting it.</li>
          <li>  The Blood Must Be Drained:   The jugular veins and carotid artery need to be cut quickly with a sharp knife to facilitate quick and humane slaughter. The blood needs to be completely drained from the carcass since eating blood is forbidden in Islam.</li>
          <li>  No Stunning or Cruelty:   Islam promotes the humane treatment of animals. The slaughtering process should be designed to cause as little suffering as possible, and gratuitous cruelty is absolutely prohibited.</li>
        </ul>
        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          The Quran says:
          <blockquote className="italic text-[#78827F] mt-2">
            "Forbidden to you are dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than Allah. But if one is compelled [by necessity], neither by want nor transgression, there is no sin for him." (Quran 5:3)

        </Text>
        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          Aside from meat, many foods have ingredients that need to be scrutinized to determine if they are Halal or Haram. Some of the common categories include:
        </Text>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mt-4 text-[#78827F]">
          <li>  Halal Ingredients:   Vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts, and legumes; Dairy products (as long as they do not contain animal-based enzymes from Haram sources); Seafood; Vegetable oils and fats.</li>
          <li>  Haram Ingredients:   Alcohol and intoxicants; Pork and pork-derived products (including gelatin, lard, and emulsifiers); Enzymes and rennet from non-Halal sources; Cross-contamination from non-Halal items.</li>
        </ul>
        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          To simplify Halal food selection, the MY Mufti App provides an ingredient-checking feature so users can confirm whether a product is permissible.

        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          Many food products today carry Halal certification, which means they have been verified by a reputable Islamic authority. Some prominent Halal certification agencies include:
        </Text>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mt-4 text-[#78827F]">
          <li>Halal Monitoring Committee (HMC) – UK</li>
          <li>Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America (IFANCA) – USA</li>
          <li>JAKIM – Malaysia</li>
          <li>Majelis Ulama Indonesia (MUI) – Indonesia</li>
        </ul>
        <Text className="font-Raleway font-[500] text-[#78827F] text-[32px]" as="p">
          These agencies audit food production operations to ensure compliance with Halal requirements.
